solr-dataimport-scheduler
=========================

A scheduler for performing solr data imports.

Based on https://code.google.com/p/solr-data-import-scheduler/, but uses:
* Quartz Job Scheduler (http://quartz-scheduler.org/)
* Apache HttpClient (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/)

It is intended to be simple, not profound.
